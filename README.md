#### Importants concepts for interviews

You should know these terms:

ECMAScript
JavaScript
Node JS

and the difference between them.

#### Questions :

What is ES6?
What is async/await?
What does "asynchronous" mean? 
What are deep / shallow copies ? (Copy of reference / Copy of value)
How to do a simple deep copy of an array or an object in JS ? (Destructuring)
What is a server ?


#### You should be able to :

- Deal with arrays of objects, ie: [{name:"foo", age:15, hobby:['sport', 'tv']}, { ... } ]

That means : 

sorting them (with or without mutating them !) : .sort
filtering them : .filter
modifying them : .map
get an average value : .reduce 
find an item inside or a index : .findIndex() // .indexOf()   || .find()

- Deal with objects 

deep copying them
add a key inside
delete a key
get all keys
get all values

- Fetch data 

master at least one way (axios, fetch, ...) to asynchronously fetch data
display the data 
practice with a few APIs (pokemon API, ...)




#### Where to practice:
